Wish/TODO List:
---------------

	* Fix object flags once and for all.  Array?  Real bitfield?
	  (Array == lots of memory, bitfield == broken compilers.)

	* Access Control Lists.  Really non-bool Control Locks, but ACL
	  sounds cooler.

	* Convert all of the command routines to argv/argc.

	* Finish peer communication support.  TCP layer needs it's own
	  state information so that we don't have to lookup host names
	  all the time.

	* Finish the command line based manager.
