Changes since TeenyMUD 2.0beta1:
	* Added `--with-gdbm' and `--with-bsddbm' configuration options,
	  and cleaned up the Makefiles.  Still needs more work, though.
	* Added INHERIT flag.  Objects can now only force their owner if
	  they (the object) is set INHERIT.  INHERIT objects also have
	  Wizard privs if their owner does.  INHERIT can only be set by
	  Players who own themselves.
	* Added TIME specification to configuration system.  Allows interval
	  settings and the like to be specified in seconds, minutes, hours,
	  or days.
	* Dump newp_file to players that've never logged in before.
	* Add the endian check back to configure.
	* Fix EXTERNAL exit (command) matching.
	* Added /all, /no_space switches to @EDIT, added $ and ^ tokens.
	* Changed signal initializations.
	* Converted variable argument functions over to ANSI.
	* Added an snprintf() implementation to the compat library, and
	  switched many calls to sprintf() in the server over to it.
	* Don't try to run queued commands for objects that don't exist.
	* If a player is set INHERIT, then it's the same as if all of their
	  objects were set INHERIT.
	* Added <> forced excution command parsing.
	* Added the %@ substitution, and lots of support goo.
	* Added ARG_FEXEC special switch.
	* Added format primitive.
	* Fixed {} quoting bug.
	* Fixed massive security hole in controls().
	* Players can login using their object number.
	* Added LIGHT and OPAQUE flags.
	* Fixed some rather nasty db and memory bugs.
	* Added support for reading vanilla TinyMUD databases.
	* Added support for filtering garbage objects.
	* Fixed a bunch more recycle bugs.
	* More Makefile changes, especially the switch to lorder/tsort.
	  (readline was toast under ranlib-less SysV without lorder/tsort.)
	* `Ported' to Ultrix 4.3 (broken strftime(3) in libc).

Changes since TeenyMUD 2.0.2beta:
	* Fixed `give' again.
	* Finished `porting' to AIX 3.2.5 using XLC.
	* Changed @group/disolve to @group/delete.
	* Expanded upgrade support for databases that don't have root rooms.
	  `convertdb' will now ask if you wish to create a new root room.
	* Fixed a small bug in `examine'.
