 * Hash_EnumFirst --
 *	This procedure sets things up for a complete search
 *	of all entries recorded in the hash table.
 *
 * Results:	
 *	The return value is the address of the first entry in
 *	the hash table, or NULL if the table is empty.
 *
 * Side Effects:
 *	The information in hashSearchPtr is initialized so that successive
 *	calls to Hash_Next will return successive HashEntry's
 *	from the table.
